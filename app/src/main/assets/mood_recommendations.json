      "tips": [
        "Pause and breathe: try 4-4-4 breathing (inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s) for 1–2 minutes.",
        "Do a quick facial release: massage jaw and temples with light circular motions for 30–60 seconds.",
        "Take a 5–10 minute walk outside to change perspective and reduce built-up tension.",
        "Use grounded posture: sit/stand with shoulders relaxed and chin level to reduce facial clenching.",
        "Write one short sentence about what’s bothering you — externalizing reduces rumination."

      "tips": [
        "Name the sensation aloud (e.g., “That feels uncomfortable”) to reduce its intensity.",
        "Try a 30-second sensory reset: hold a cool glass of water and focus on the feeling.",
        "Soften your face: deliberately relax mouth, forehead and jaw for 20 seconds.",
        "Limit immediate avoidance—step back briefly, breathe, then decide the next action.",

        "Slow diaphragmatic breathing: 4–6 slow breaths per minute for two minutes.",
        "Ground with senses: list 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.",
        "Lower screen brightness and take soft-focus breaks to avoid wide-eyed strain.",
        "Try progressive muscle relaxation for face: tense 3s, release 7s, focusing on jaw/forehead.",

        "Apply cold/warm compress to the face or eyes for 5–10 minutes to reduce puffiness and refresh.",
        "Practice light movement (stretching or a 10-minute walk) to increase circulation and energy.",
        "Use gentle facial massage (cheeks, under-eyes) to relieve stagnation and improve circulation.",
